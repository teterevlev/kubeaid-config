    # We're installing the ArgoCD Helm chart. Then creating argocd ArgoCD App to manage that ArgoCD
    # installation.
    # Now, initially, when we create the argocd ArgoCD App, it isn't managing ArgoCD. All the
    # Kubernetes resources associated with the App, thus doesn't have the
    # "argocd.argoproj.io/instance: argocd" label.
    # It's only when we sync the App, it starts managing ArgoCD, thus adding labels to all the
    # resources managed by it. This causes checksum changes, which triggers pod restarts.
    #
    # We are preventing the "argocd.argoproj.io/instance: argocd" label to be considered during
    # checksum calculation. So there will be no checksum change (and thus Pod restarts) when we
    # sync the argocd ArgoCD App.
